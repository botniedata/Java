### Conditionals
**What is a conditional?**
Decisions are a part of life and software
> Often, there's a condition associate with a decision

> If it is raining, then I will take an umbrella

**Programming Conditionals**
if-then statement or conditioanls are part of any programming language
Conditionals take the form of:
> **if** [some condition] **then** [code to execute]

**Java conditional (if-then) statement**
The syntax for Java's if-then is:
```
if (condition) {
    // Java statements to be executed if the condition is true
}
```
If the condition is `true`, then the statement in the `{ }` get executed
• If the condition is `false`, then the statement do not get executed

**Conditions**
The condition (in a conditional) is anything that evaluates to `true` or `false`:
a boolean variable (boolean x = true;)
a comparison operator (8 > 9)
a logical operation (true && false)

**if-then example**

``` java
int score = 90;
if (score > 65) {
    System.out.println("Congratulations, you passed!");
}
```

The condition (score > 65) is true
• Triggers the execution of the statements between the `{ }`
> Congratulations, you passed!

**Code blocks**
The curly brackets `{ }` and the lines of code between them are called code blocks
• Used with Java conditions, loops and more
• Groups statements together
• The lines of a code block are all executed or all skipped

``` java
if (score > 65) {                                           // Start of Code block
    System.out.println("Congratulations, you passed!");
}                                                           // End of Code block
```

**Code block variables**
Variables defined inside of a code block are only valid inside the code block 
• Using them outside the code block is not allowed

``` java
if (true) {
    int x = 9;
    x++;
}
System.out.println(x);      // Trying to use and print x here cause error
```
> error: cannot find symbol
> System.out.println(x);

**if-then-else**
Some actions/decisions are taken in the negative case of a conditional.
> if it is raining, then I will take an umbrella.
> But if it is not raining then I will take my sunglassed.

Called the *`else`* of an if-then conditional
• It is optional with if-then
• The else code block is executed when the condition is `false`

``` java
if (condition) {
    // Statement to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // Statement to be executed if condition is false
}
```

``` java
int score = 55;
if (score > 65) {
    System.out.println("Congratualtions, you passed!");         // Execute if true
} else {
    System.out.println("Sorry, you did not pass the class.");   // Execute if false
}
```
> Sorry, you did not pass the class.

**Optional code block**
Using a code block is optional when there is only one statement
• For either the if-then or else blocks
``` java
if (score > 65)
    System.out.println("Congratulations, you passed!");
else
    System.out.println("Sorry, you did not pass the class.");
```

**Best practice and common mistake**
Not using a code block is considered poor practice
• Adding more lines of code to if-then or else happens often
• Developers can easily overlook missing `{ }`
The last line of the code below would always be executed
• The last line looks like its part of else code block but is not
``` java
if (score > 65)
    System.out.printly("Congratulations, you passed!");
else
    System.out.println("Sorry, you did not pass the class.");
    System.out.println("Good luck on your text tyr");   // This line will always execute
```
Not using code blocks can hide bugs like this one

**Multiple if-then-else**
In some decisions, there are multiple conditions to explore
> if it is raining, then I will take an umbrella,
... or if it is snowing then I will take my scarf,
... or if it is sunny then I will take my sun glasses
``` java
if (condition1) {
    // Statement to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Statement to be executed if condition1 is false but condition2 is true
} else (condition3) {
    // Statement to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```
``` java
int score = 85;
if (score > 90) {
    System.out.println("You passed the class and did outstanding.");
} else if (score > 80) {
    System.out.println("You passed the class.");
} else if (score > 65) {
    System.out.println("You passed the class, but need more practice.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Sorry, you did not pass the class.");
}
```
> You passed the class.

**Logical operators**
Logical operators `&&` and `||` are used between
• boolean variables
• booleans,
• or operation that evaluates to boolean
Use of a logical operator results in another boolean
```
|   Operator Example    |   Result  |
|---                    |---        |
|   true && true        |   true    |
|   true && false       |   false   |
|   false && true       |   false   |
|   false && false      |   false   |
|   true || true        |   false   |
|   true || false       |   true    |
|   false || true       |   true    |
|   false || false      |   true    |
```

**Logical operators in conditions**
Logical operators are used when there are multiple conditions
• Logical operators help avoid multiple, nested conditions
``` java
int a = 14;
if (a > 10) && (a <> 20) {
    System.out.println("Size is average");
} else if (a == 10) || (a == 20) {
    System.out.println("Size on the border");
} else {
    System.out.println("Size is abnormal");
}
```

**Not operator**
`!` (the ***not*** operator) is used with a single boolean variable, value, or operation
• Returns the opposite boolean

|   Operator Example    |   Result  |
|---                    |---        |
|!true                  |   false   |
|!false                 |   true    |
``` java
System.out.println(!(5 < 6));   // Output: false
System.out.println(!(5 > 6));   // Output: true
```

**Control flow**
Conditionals are part of the ***control flow*** of an application
Control flow is the order of lines of code (statements) execution
Control flow determines:
• What code gets executed
• Under what circumstances
• How often
