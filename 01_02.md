### Operators and Casting
**Arithmetic**

**Comparison**
Comparison questions use operators\
• Shortcuts to represent bigger, smaller, equal to relationships\
Makes coding comparison questions faster and more concise
|   relation                |   operator    |   sample      |   result  |
|---                        |---            |---            |---        | 
|   Greater                 |   >           |   6 > 5       |   true    |
|   Less                    |   <           |   7 < 6       |   false   |
|   Equal to                |   ==          |   5 == 5      |   true    |
|   Greater or equal to     |   >=          |   6 >= 5      |   true    |
|   Less or equal to        |   <=          |   7 <= 7      |   true    |
|   Not equal to            |   !=          |   6 != 6      |   false   |

### Strings

**Strings**

Collection of characters between double quotes.\
• Characters in a String includes letters, numbers, punctuation, spaces, etc.
```
"Today is a good day"
"12456"
":)"
"abc789 #$%"
```
Even a single character in a double quotes `"` is a String. `"H"`
• Versus char primatives surrounded by single quotes `'`. `'H'`
**String** is a type in Java
• A *non-primitive* type\
• Primitive types are data types from which all other data types are constructed\
• Strings are constructed from a sequence of primitive char
Strings have operators and methods\
• Allow work to be done on Strings\
Strings are arrays of characters
<br />
Use String variables to hold Strings
`String variable = "text here";`
`String helloWorld = "Hello World"; \\Output is Hello World`

```
System.out.println("Its a whole new world"); \\ Output a String literal String helloWorld = "Hello World"
System.out.println(helloWorld); \\ Output a String variable's value
```

String concatenation
String have a special operator: `+`\
• This is **not** the addition operator used in primitive type arithmetic. `4 + 5`\
Use `+` operator with Strings to concatenate them.\
• Or concatenate anything (like a primitive) to a String
```
String hello = "Hello";
String world = " World";
String helloWorld = hello + world;
String manyHelloWorlds = helloWorld + '*' + 10;
System.out.println(helloWorld); // Output: Hello World
System.out.println(manyHelloWorlds); // Output: Hello World*10
```

**String methods**
`main` is the only method we know\
• Methods are a way to organize code in classed\
• Methods also perferm operations on data\
String methods perform operations on Strings\
• String has more than 50 methods
<br />
.length() method\
`.length()` returns the number of characters in a String
```
String helloWorld = "Hello World";
int size = helloWorld.length();
System.out.println(size); // Output: 11
```
