### Operators and Casting
**Arithmetic**
|   name                                    |   sign    |   sample                                |   result      |

|   Addition                                |   +       |   `int a = 5 + 6;`                      |   11          |
|   Multiplication                          |   *       |   `int b = a * 7;`                      |   77          |
|   Subtraction                             |   -       |   `int c = b - a; `                     |   66          |
|   Division                                |   /       |   `double d = c / 6;`                   |   11.0        |

|   Increment ++: add one to the value      |   ++      |   `y++; `                               |   6           |
|   Decrement --: remove one to the value   |   --      |   `y--;`                                |   5           |

**Comparison**
Comparison questions use operators\
• Shortcuts to represent bigger, smaller, equal to relationships\
Makes coding comparison questions faster and more concise
|   relation                |   operator    |   sample      |   result  |
|---                        |---            |---            |---        | 
|   Greater                 |   >           |   6 > 5       |   true    |
|   Less                    |   <           |   7 < 6       |   false   |
|   Equal to                |   ==          |   5 == 5      |   true    |
|   Greater or equal to     |   >=          |   6 >= 5      |   true    |
|   Less or equal to        |   <=          |   7 <= 7      |   true    |
|   Not equal to            |   !=          |   6 != 6      |   false   |

### Strings
**Strings**
Collection of characters between double quotes.\
• Characters in a String includes letters, numbers, punctuation, spaces, etc.
```
"Today is a good day"
"12456"
":)"
"abc789 #$%"
```
Even a single character in a double quotes `"` is a String. `"H"`
• Versus char primatives surrounded by single quotes `'`. `'H'`
**String** is a type in Java
• A *non-primitive* type\
• Primitive types are data types from which all other data types are constructed\
• Strings are constructed from a sequence of primitive char
Strings have operators and methods\
• Allow work to be done on Strings\
Strings are arrays of characters
<br />
Use String variables to hold Strings
`String variable = "text here";`
`String helloWorld = "Hello World"; \\Output is Hello World`

```
System.out.println("Its a whole new world"); \\ Output a String literal String helloWorld = "Hello World"
System.out.println(helloWorld); \\ Output a String variable's value
```
