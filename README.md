# Java

### Comments

Use comments to leave human readable information in the code\
• Comment are ignored by compilers, tools, and the JRE\
• Comment lines are marked by `//`\
Because they are ignored, coments can go anywhere in the code

---

### class
#### `class` keyword followed by the class name with curly brackets `{}`
```
// Java code goes into a class
class FirstJavaApp {

}
```

---

### Methods
Java applications consist of hundreds of classed\
   • Methods are like sub-containers for code inside of classes\
   • Each method accomplished a small, discrete bit of work\
Methods define reusable sets of code\
   • Allowing the same code to be used with different output
   • Producing different outputs

---

### Java method
Java starts executing from the `main` method\
Define the main method with `main` and its own curly brackets `{}`\
   • `public statid void` precedes `main`\
   • `(String[] args)` after `main`\
``` 
class FirstJavaApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    } // main: starting point for an application
}     // method: sub-containers for code
```

### Terminology cheat sheet
**class**: a container for organizing Java code\
**comment**: human readable information in Java code that Java ignores\
**method**: like sub-containters for code inside of classes\
**main method**: the starting point of kick off place for Java application
